    Algorithm: Incorporate Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, such as actor-critic methods, to learn optimal policies for navigation tasks.‚Äã

    Features: This module can predict and adapt to dynamic environmental changes, improving the sailboat's autonomy over time.‚Äã

    Implementation: Train the DRL model in simulated environments before deploying it onboard for real-time learning and adaptation.‚Äã

‚öôÔ∏è System Integration

Objective: Ensure seamless operation between different modules for coherent navigation.‚Äã

    Architecture: Design a hierarchical control system where the global planner sets waypoints, the local planner navigates between them, and the adaptive module fine-tunes decisions based on learning.‚Äã

    Communication: Establish robust communication protocols between onshore servers and the sailboat to update plans as needed.‚Äã

    Redundancy: Implement fail-safes and redundancy in critical systems to handle unexpected failures or anomalies.‚Äã
