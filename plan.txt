⚓ 1. THE CORE IDEA

    ❝ Build an AI agent that plots a realistic, optimized sailing route from point A to B on a body of water (e.g., lake or sea region), using wind and vessel performance as constraints. ❞

🧠 Key Difference from Traditional Pathfinding:

    Boats can't go directly upwind – must tack

    Wind changes over time – dynamic cost

    Speed isn't uniform – depends on wind angle

    You don’t always want shortest distance, but shortest time (which may require sailing away from the goal)

This is a Time-Dependent, Vector-Aware Routing Problem.
🗺️ 2. PHASED PLAN OF ATTACK

Each stage builds on the last — small, testable units, getting progressively closer to the real deal.
📍 Phase 1: Map + Wind Environment
Goal: Create a small, navigable grid that includes:

    Land + sea (grid cells)

    Wind vectors per cell (2D field)

    Start + goal location

What You’ll Do:

    Generate a 2D numpy map (lake or ocean region)

    Overlay wind: either constant, or synthetic (noise-based) for realism

    Create a basic sailboat physics class (with polar plot/VMG logic, even if simplified)

Deliverables:

    A sim grid

    A sailboat that can move realistically according to wind (not just shortest path)

📍 Phase 2: Smart Navigator (Heuristic AI)
Goal: Write a non-AI routing algorithm that respects sailing physics (can’t go upwind, must tack)
What You’ll Do:

    Implement a variant of A* or Best-First Search, using ETA (not distance) as cost

    Model time to cross grid cells based on wind angle and boat’s VMG

Key Challenge:

    Precompute time-to-travel for each angle vs wind angle (i.e., speed polar diagram)

    Backtrack intelligently (i.e., sometimes you sail away from the goal first)

Deliverables:

    Sailing-aware path planner

    Visualization of plotted course, wind, and “sailable” cells

📍 Phase 3: AI-Assisted Planner (Reinforcement Learning or Sequence Modeling)
Goal: Introduce real AI — not just pathfinding, but learning optimal navigation behavior over time
Two Possible Routes:
Option A: RL Agent (e.g., DQN, PPO)

    State: wind grid + boat pos/heading/speed

    Action: choose heading (discretized)

    Reward: distance to goal reduced, or inverse of ETA

    Training: in sim, with reward shaping

Option B: Sequence Model (e.g., LSTM)

    Input: past wind history, boat state

    Output: best next heading

    Could work with supervised labels from Phase 2

Deliverables:

    Trained agent that can sail toward goal intelligently in dynamic wind

📍 Phase 4: Real Data Integration (Optional for PoC)
Plug in real datasets:

    Wind: from GFS/OpenMeteo

    Map: from OSM coastline masks

    Boat model: rough polar data (or learn from log)

This validates your sim with realism.

🎯 4. FINAL GOAL (PoC Target)

You should have a simulation where:

    The environment is sailing-aware

    The AI plots a path, then executes it

    You can visualize:

        Wind

        Obstacles

        Path taken

        Efficiency (time vs direct distance)

Bonus: add toggle to compare your AI planner vs a naive shortest path planner (to highlight gains).
🔮 5. OPTIONAL (for later)

    Add multi-agent coordination (fleet routing)

    Introduce uncertainty in weather forecasts

    Expand to open ocean + real traffic avoidance (AIS simulation)

    Consider energy harvesting (solar/sail optimization hybrid)

    Combine with evolutionary algorithms to evolve boat design for routes
